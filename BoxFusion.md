## Quick Reference: Key Behavioral Skills Talking Points

**Problem-Solving**: "I approach problems systematically by breaking them down, researching solutions, testing hypotheses, and iterating"

**Attention to Detail**: "I review my code multiple times, use linting tools, write unit tests, and welcome peer reviews"

**Adaptability**: "I'm comfortable with ambiguity and see changing requirements as opportunities to learn"

**Communication**: "I document my work clearly and adapt my explanation based on my audience's technical level"

**Continuous Learning**: "I follow tech blogs, take online courses, and experiment with new technologies in personal projects"

## Pro Tips

ðŸŽ¯ **For Technical Questions**: Think out loud, ask clarifying questions, and don't be afraid to say "I don't know, but here's how I'd find out"

ðŸŽ¯ **For Behavioral Questions**: Use STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and always end with what you learned

ðŸŽ¯ **Show Enthusiasm**: Express genuine interest in learning and growing with the team

Good luck! Remember: They're hiring a *graduate* - they expect potential and willingness to learn, not perfection.
